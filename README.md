Developer Compensation EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Developer Salary, Experience, and Job Satisfaction

This project analyzes global developer compensation data to understand how professional experience and job satisfaction relate to yearly earnings. Using real Stack Overflow survey data, the analysis applies modern Python EDA techniques to uncover statistically meaningful insights about global salary trends.
